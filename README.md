Determining how user duration differs among different types of users 


## What is the story? 

As public schools have shut down across the country, students and educators at all levels have been forced to develop new strategies.  One of the primary strategies has been educational apps.  

In my case my 7 year old son, his teachers have directed us towards Splash Math for Math and Epic Books for reading practice. Because the teachers are connected to these apps, they are able to see our son's progress. On top of this we have been using two additional apps to help him keep up with his studies. We are using Duolingo for Chinese and Khan Academy for Math.   

As the school closure persists and the possibility of an even longer closure persists. I wonder how long will we stick with these apps.  Typically with educational apps, I stick with them for a little while, but I get bored and then stop.  With a long term school closure, the stakes seem much higher. As parents are working and have less time than a clasroom teacher, we are relying on apps to teach and engage our students more and for longer than ever.  

Unfortunately, the apps that we are using don't make their data publicly available.  

Finding a good set of education app/website data was not easy! After a lot of searching across of a variety of open data platforms.  I found

## What is Junyi Academy
Junyi Academy is a Chinese platform that was started with the help of Khan Academy, and uses many of the same strategies and metrics to teach students.   In this way, it will provide an approximation of the applications that many students around the world are currently using.
